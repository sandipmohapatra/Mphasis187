Lifecycle hook of Angular.
--------------------------------------------
ngOnChanges - When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.

ngOnInit - This is called whenever the initialization of the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.

ngDoCheck - This is for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.

ngAfterContentInit - This is called in response after Angular projects external content into the component's view.

ngAfterContentChecked - This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.

ngAfterViewInit - This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.

ngAfterViewChecked - This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.

ngOnDestroy - This is the cleanup phase just before Angular destroys the directive/component.

example of implementing one lifecycle hook. 
 app.component.ts 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
import {    Component } from '@angular/core';  
@Component ({ 
   selector: 'my-app', 
   template: '<div> {{values}} </div> ' 
}) 
export class AppComponent { 
   values = ' '; 
   ngOnInit() { 
      this.values = "Hello"; 
   } 

}
